        # The order of the patterns matters, just like in Djangoâ€™s url() function.
        # The first pattern that matches will be used.
        # If no pattern matches, the connection will be rejected.
        # The URLRouter will also reject connections that do not have a valid path value.
        # The path value must be a valid Python identifier.
        # For example, /ws/chat/room%20name/ will be rejected because it contains a space.
